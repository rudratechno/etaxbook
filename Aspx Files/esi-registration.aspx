                    <h4>Lower Taxes</h4>
                    <p>Currently in some states under the VAT regime, businesses are required to comply with VAT regulations once they cross an annual turnover of Rs.5 lakhs. Under GST regime, GST liability accrues only if an entity crosses an annual turnover of Rs.10 lakhs in northeast or hill states, whereas for rest of India, the threshold is set at Rs.20 lakhs.</p>

                    <h4>Larger Tax Base</h4>
                    <p>GST is expected to increase the tax base in India significantly. Hence, the overall tax liability for businesses is expected to reduce overtime, as more and more businesses become compliant. Further, GST will use the latest in technology, including data from Aadhaar database, PAN database, etc., to make GST registration and GST return filing process, as seamless as possible.</p>

                    <h4>Ease of Doing Business</h4>
                    <p>Currently, many businesses like restaurants, computer sales and services businesses have to comply with both VAT and Service Tax regulations. This creates a compliance burden on the business, as they have to calculate taxes for the transaction based on different rates for different items. Under GST, the distinction between goods and services will be gone – making doing business easy.</p>
