               The name of a company or LLP can be changed by the promoters at anytime after incorporation. Some of the major reasons for change of company name are business model change, change of promoters, rebranding, etc., To change the name of a company, shareholders approval is required along with approval from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The change of name of a company or LLP however has no impact on the legal entity or its existence. Hence, all assets and liabilities of the entity would continue, while only the name of the company would have been changed.
                <br /><br />
Change of company name requires passing of a board resolution, obtaining name approval from MCA, passing of a special resolution and applying for approval of new company name to the MCA. If the MCA accepts the application, a new certificate of incorporation is issued. After obtaining the new certificate of incorporation, changes must be made to incorporate and change the MOA and AOA of the company as well.

In a private limited company, the consent of other shareholders maybe required to effect share transfers.</p>
