For a cheque bounce notice to be valid, it must contain reference to Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, information about when the cheque was presented, the reason for non-realization of payment and a request to the cheque issuer to arrange for payment immediately through alternate means. A Section 138 Notice must be presented to the cheque issuer within 30 days of return of cheque due to be valid.
