                Partnership firms are required to maintain compliance like LLPs and Companies registered in India. Partnership firm compliance mainly includes filing of income tax return, while corporate entities like LLP and Company require both income tax return filing with the Income Tax Department and annual return filing with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. Partnership firms having annual turnover of over Rs.100 lakhs are also required to obtain a tax audit.

                In addition to the basic compliance, partnership firms may also be required to comply with TDS regulations, GST regulations, VAT / CST regulations, Service Tax regulations, ESI regulations and others.
