              Partners in a LLP are responsible for the carrying on the business of the LLP. To add a Partner to a LLP, the person proposing to become a Partner must obtain a digital signature certificate (DSC) and director identification number (DIN). DIN can be obtained for any person who is above the age of 18. The nationality or residency status of the DIN applicant does not matters. Hence, Indian Nationals, Non-Resident Indians and Foreign Nationals can obtain DIN and be appointed as Partner of a LLP in India.
