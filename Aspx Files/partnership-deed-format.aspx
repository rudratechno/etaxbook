                A partnership deed is a written legal document to avoid unnecessary misunderstanding, harassment and unpleasantness among the partners in the event of any dispute. For mutual benefit, the registration of Deed of Partnership is made under the Indian Registration Act, 1908 so as to avoid apprehension of the Deed of partnership being destroyed or mutilated in the possession of the partners. However, a partnership firm can also be created without registration under the Indian Registration Act, by just entering into a deep of Partnership. An instrument of partnership may be constituted by more than one document, meaning an amendment agreement can be added to a partnership deed at anytime to change the terms of a Partnership Firm.
