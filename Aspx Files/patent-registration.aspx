              Patent is an exclusive right for an invention provided by the law for a limited time to the Patentee. By patenting an invention, the patentee is able to control the making, using, selling or importing of the patented product or process for producing that product without his/her consent. For an invention to be patentable in India, the invention must be a new product or process, involving an inventive step and capable of being made or used in an industry. Patent registrations have a validity of 20 years from the date of filing of patent application, irrespective of whether it is filed with provisional or complete specification.
                <br /><br />
Patent registration applications are handled by the The Patent Office, Controller General of Patents, Designs & Trade Marks. Patent applications can be filed electronically with provisional or complete specification, at the appropriate Patent Office.
