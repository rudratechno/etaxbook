               Companies in India must conduct an Annual General Meeting at the end of each financial year and file an annual return with the Ministry of Corporate Affair to maintain compliance. For newly incorporated Companies, the Annual General Meeting should be held within 18 months from date of incorporation or 9 months from the date of closing of financial year, whichever is earlier. Subsequent Annual General Meeting should be held within 6 months from the end of that financial year. In India, normally the financial year starts on April 1st and end on 31st March. So a Company's annual return would be on September 30th.
                <br /><br />
Annual return consists of information and documents that include the Balance Sheet of the Company, Profit & Loss Account, Compliance Certificate, Registered Office Address, Register of Member, Shares and Debentures details, Debt details and information about the Management of the Company. The annual return would also disclose the shareholding structure of the Company, changes in Directorship and details of transfers of securities. E-Tax Book Solutions can help file your Company's annual return in India.
