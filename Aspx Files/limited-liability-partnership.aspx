               Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) was introduced in India by way of the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008. The basic premise behind the introduction of Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is to provide a form of business entity that is simple to maintain while providing limited liability to the owners. Since, its introduction in 2010, LLPs have been well received with over 1 lakhs registrations so far until September, 2014.
                <br />
                <br />
                The main advantage of a Limited Liability Partnership over a traditional partnership firm is that in a LLP, one partner is not responsible or liable for another partner's misconduct or negligence. A LLP also provides limited liability protection for the owners from the debts of the LLP. Therefore, all partners in a LLP enjoy a form of limited liability protection for each individual's protection within the partnership, similar to that of the shareholders of a private limited company. However, unlike private limited company shareholder, the partners of a LLP have the right to manage the business directly.
                 <br />
                <br />
                LLP is one of the easiest form of business to incorporate and manage in India. With an easy incorporation process and simple compliance formalities, LLP is preferred by Professionals, Micro and Small businesses that are family owned or closely-held. Since, LLPs are not capable of issuing equity shares, LLP should be used for any business that has plans for raising equity funds during its lifecycle.

                    <div class="agileits_w3layouts_service_grid">

                    </div>
                    <h4>Separate Legal Entity</h4>
                    <p>A LLP is a legal entity and a juristic person established under the Act. Therefore, a LLP has wide legal capacity and can own property and also incur debts. However, the Partners of a LLP have no liability to the creditors of a LLP for the debts of the LLP.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-3 agile_services_grid">
                    <div class="agileits_w3layouts_service_grid">

                    </div>
                     <h4>Uninterrupted Existence</h4>
                    <p>A LLP has 'perpetual succession', that is continued or uninterrupted existence until it is legally dissolved. A LLP being a separate legal person, is unaffected by the death or other departure of any Partner. Hence, a LLP continues to be in existence irrespective of the changes in ownership.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-3 agile_services_grid">

                    </div>
                    <h4>Easy Transferability</h4>
                    <p>The ownership of a LLP can be easily transferred to another person by inducting them as a Partner of the LLP. LLP is a separate legal entity separate from its Partners, so by changing the Partners, the ownership of the LLP can be changed.</p>

                    <h4>Owning Property</h4>
                    <p>A LLP being an artificial judicial person, can acquire, own, enjoy and sell, property in its name. No Partner can make any claim upon the property of the LLP - so long as the LLP is a going concern.</p>
