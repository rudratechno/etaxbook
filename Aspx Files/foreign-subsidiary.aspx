               Foreign subsidiary companies are mandatorily required to maintain compliance as per Income Tax Act, Companies Act, transfer pricing guidelines and FEMA guidelines. Hence, maintaining compliance for a foreign subsidiary company would includes filing of income tax return with the Income Tax Department, annual return with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and other filings with authorities like Reserve Bank of India or Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Finally, like all companies, foreign subsidiaries would also have to comply with other Indian tax regulations like TDS regulations, GST regulations, VAT / CST regulations, Service Tax regulations, ESI regulations and others. The compliance requirement for a foreign subsidiary company would vary based on the industry, state of incorporation, number of employees and sales turnover.
