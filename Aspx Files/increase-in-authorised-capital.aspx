                The authorised capital of a Company determines the number of shares a Company can issue to its shareholders. An increase in authorized capital might be required for issuing new shares and/or inducting more capital into the Company. The initial authorised capital of the Company is mentioned in the Memorandum of Association of the Company and is usually Rs. 1 lakh. The authorised capital can be increased by the company at anytime with shareholders approval and by paying additional fee to the Registrar of Companies.
                <br /><br />
To begin the process for increasing authorized capital a resolution must be passed by the Board of Directors. In the Board Resolution, authorisation must be provided for increasing the authorised capital of the company and making the necessary changes to the MOA and AOA of the company. IndiaFilings can help you easily increase the authorised capital of your company.
