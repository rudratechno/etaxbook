                Board resolution for opening bank account is a resolution passed in a Board Meeting authorizing certain persons in a company to open and operate the Bank account of a Company or LLP. As a Company is a separate legal entity, the board resolution for opening bank accounting is required in addition to the other documents for opening a bank account. In case the Company wishes to have Bank accounts with various banks, then separate Board Resolutions must be executed for each of the Bank in which account is to be opened. Board resolution for opening of bank account is one of the first resolutions executed after incorporation of company or LLP.
