              LLPs in India must file its Annual Return within 60 days from the end of close of financial year and Statement of Account & Solvency within 30 days from end of six months of close of financial year. Unlike Companies, LLPs mandatorily have to maintain their financial year, as April 1st to March 31st. Therefore, LLP annual return is due on May 30th and the Statement of Account & Solvency is due on October 30th of each financial year.
                <br /><br />
LLPs are separate legal entities; therefore, it is the responsibility of the Designated Partners to maintain proper book of accounts and file annual return with the MCA each financial year. LLPs are not required to audit its accounts unless the annual turnover exceeds Rs.40 lakhs or if the contribution exceeds Rs.25 lakhs. Therefore, LLP who do not have to get the accounts audited if it satisfies the above condition, making the annual filing process a simple and easy one. E-Tax Book Solutions can help file the Annual return for your LLP.
