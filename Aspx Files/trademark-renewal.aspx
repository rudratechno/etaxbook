                Trademark registration is a type of intellectual property protection, under which a word or visual symbol used by a business to distinguish its goods or services from other similar goods or services originating from a different business can be protected. To register a trademark, a trademark application must be filed by the applicant with the relevant Trade Mark Registrar in the prescribed format. Once a trademark application is filed, the Trade Marks Registrar would process the application and provide registration under the Trade Mark Act. On registration of a trademark, the R symbol can be used along with the trademark and the registration is valid for a period of 10 years. During registration, in case of infringement of trademark, a suit can be filed to prevent misuse of the mark.
