                   <h4>10 Year Protection</h4>
                    <p>Designs registered under the Designs Act are protected for a period of ten years, renewable by another 5 years. However, design registration mainly applies only to designs applied by an industrial process on any article. Hence, items that are covered under the Trademark Act or Copyright Act cannot be registered as a design.</p>

                     <h4>Combination Mark</h4>
                    <p>Combination marks or iconic logotypes are a combination of word mark and symbol mark - associating both the name of the company and a visual icon. Combination marks can often be split apart, giving the ability to use the text or the symbol independently if the situation calls for it. Also, from a legal perspective, combination marks tend to be easier to trademark than symbol-only logos or word mark logos. Nike, Adidas, Pizza Hut are all examples of combination mark.</p>

                    <p>Symbol marks are logos that consists only of a symbol or icon without the use of words or letters. Symbol mark can be risky as it does not convey the name of the entity in the logo. Hence, symbol marks are not recommended for a new startup or a smaller company that's trying to get people more familiar with their brand. Apple Computers, LG and Microsoft are all good examples of symbol mark.</p>
