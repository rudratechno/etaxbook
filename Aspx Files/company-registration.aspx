                Private Limited Company is the most prevalent and popular type of corporate legal entity in India. Private limited company registration is governed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Companies Act, 2013 and the Companies Incorporation Rules, 2014. To register a private limited company, a minimum of two shareholders and two directors are required. A natural person can be both a director and shareholder, while a corporate legal entity can only be a shareholder. Further, foreign nationals, foreign corporate entities or NRIs are allowed to be Directors and/or Shareholders of a Company with Foreign Direct Investment, making it the preferred choice of entity for foreign promoters.
                <br />
                <br />
               Unique features of a private limited company like limited liability protection to shareholders, ability to raise equity funds, separate legal entity status and perpetual existence make it the most recommended type of business entity for millions of small and medium sized businesses that are family owned or professionally managed.

                    <p>Private Limited Company is a legal entity and a juristic person established under the Companies Act. Hence, a company has a range of legal capacities including opening of a bank account, hiring of employees, taking on equity or obtaining licenses and more as an independent corporate entity. The members (Shareholders/Directors) of a company have no personal liability to the creditors of a company for company's debts.</p>
