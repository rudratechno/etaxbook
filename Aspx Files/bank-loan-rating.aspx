              Bank loan rating from external agencies are used by Banks, Vendors, Financial Institutions, Investors and others to gauge the financial health of an Enterprise and its ability to make timely payment of its bank loan, including principal and interest payment. Various external credit rating agencies like CRISIL, ICRA, CARE, Brickworks and others have been authorised by the Government to rate the bank loan facilities enjoyed by businesses in India. Further, to improve awareness about credit rating and its benefit, the Government of India also provides a subsidy for MSME businesses to obtain SME credit rating.
